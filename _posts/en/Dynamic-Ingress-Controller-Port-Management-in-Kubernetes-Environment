### Log Entry: Dynamic Ingress Controller Port Management in Kubernetes Environment

#### **Context and Reasons**

As Kubernetes environments continue to evolve, there is an increasing need for solutions that can automatically respond to changes in the environment. This is especially true for **Ingress Controllers**, which manage external and internal communication ports. The following problems have arisen that highlight the need for dynamic port management:

1. **Static Configurations**: The traditional approach, where each port and application must be manually configured, is not scalable and has significant potential for errors. The necessity for manual intervention every time a new application is deployed or configuration changes occur slows down the development cycle and increases the risk of mistakes.

2. **Managing Ports for Different Applications**: When deploying various applications, such as **Zabbix** or **Graylog**, new ports might be required for the **Ingress Controller**, which demands manual configuration. Adding each port is not only time-consuming but also prone to errors, especially when working with multiple environments and dynamic configurations.

3. **Automatic Addition and Update of Ports**: To make the system scalable, there is a need for a mechanism that can automatically detect when new ports are required and update the **Ingress Controller** configuration without manual intervention.

#### **Possible Solutions**

Several solutions have been proposed to address the problems above, offering different levels of automation and flexibility for Kubernetes environments:

1. **Static Helm Charts and Configurations**:
   The simplest solution is to pre-define all applications and ports in Helm charts, which would automatically provide all necessary configurations during deployment. However, this solution is not scalable because any change would require a redeployment, which would involve manual intervention and would not dynamically respond to changes in the system.

2. **Kubernetes Operators**:
   Kubernetes operators provide a powerful solution for managing dynamic configurations. With operators, the environment can automatically monitor for changes and respond accordingly without requiring manual intervention. An operator would update the **Ingress Controller** configuration automatically, adding new ports to **Services** and **Ingresses** as needed, ensuring smooth system operations and process continuity.

3. **Custom Resource Definition (CRD) Based Management**:
   The most advanced and dynamic solution is to define all necessary data using a **Custom Resource Definition (CRD)** and manage configurations via an **operator**. The CRD provides custom resources that can be managed via the Kubernetes API, allowing all applications, ports, and configurations to be dynamically updated. The operator takes care of updating the **Ingress Controller**, **Service**, and **Ingress** resources as necessary.

#### **Implementing the CRD Operator**

Using a CRD and operator ensures the system can handle dynamic updates automatically, providing a central location for storing all configurations. The solution can be broken down into the following steps:

1. **Create the CRD**: The CRD would define all the necessary data for managing **Ingress Controller** ports, such as:
   - The required ports and their types.
   - Applications that need the ports.
   - Managing the **Ingress Controller** configuration files.

2. **Develop the Operator**: The operator would continuously monitor the CRD, and when new applications or ports are added, it would automatically update the Kubernetes environment's **Ingress Controller** pod, as well as the corresponding **Services** and **Ingresses**.

3. **Integration and Updates**: The operator would continuously monitor changes in the environment and automatically respond when new applications or ports are added to the system. Updates are pulled from the CRD, so the system dynamically adapts to changes, ensuring that all ports and configurations are accurately updated and set according to the requirements.

#### **Final Remarks**

Implementing dynamic **Ingress Controller** port management using a CRD and operator enables Kubernetes environments to be flexible in responding to new application and port requirements. Instead of static configurations, this automated dynamic system ensures easier maintenance, reduces the risk of errors, and improves scalability. The development of an operator and the CRD-based solution provides the ability to continuously evolve and adapt to changing needs, ensuring smooth operations and simplified configuration management in Kubernetes environments.
