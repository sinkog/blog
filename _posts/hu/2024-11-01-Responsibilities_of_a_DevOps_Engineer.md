# What is the Main Responsibility of DevOps?

The role of DevOps spans from the moment a programming requirement arises until the end of operations. The main goal of a DevOps engineer is to ensure that if an error occurs in any part of the process, it is identified as quickly as possible. This can be achieved by ensuring the transparency of processes and implementing continuous automated checks.

The fundamental difference in the DevOps mindset compared to traditional approaches is that DevOps engineers think not just in terms of processes, but in terms of states. These states are the results of the underlying processes, and the processes serve to achieve the desired state, not the other way around.

Additionally, DevOps engineers proactively seek and answer questions that have not yet arisen regarding the project. This proactivity is crucial for maintaining system stability and preventing issues.

## Practical Challenges

Naturally, this is an ideal state, and in reality, there is not always the possibility for complete transparency, immediate error detection, or answering every question. DevOps engineers often face unexpected events that must be handled dynamically and flexibly. Therefore, their task is not only to identify errors and problems but also to respond appropriately and quickly, making the ability to perform damage control essential for successful operations.

## Summary

DevOps is not just about the use of technological tools; it is also about a mindset. Successful DevOps engineers must be able to apply these principles in practice and respond flexibly to continuously changing environments and challenges.
