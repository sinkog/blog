# Responsibilities of a DevOps Engineer

The role of a DevOps engineer spans from the moment a programming requirement arises until the end of operations. Their main responsibility is to ensure that if there is an error in any part of the process, it is identified as quickly as possible. This can be achieved through the transparency of processes and the implementation and support of continuous automated checks.

## Differences in Mindset

The main difference in mindset compared to the pre-DevOps world is that a DevOps engineer thinks not in terms of processes, but in terms of states. While there are indeed processes behind these states, the process is written to correspond to the state rather than the process creating the state.

## Answering Questions

Additionally, a DevOps engineer seeks and answers questions related to the project. Naturally, this is an idealized state; in practice, there is often not enough time, and there is no possibility for complete transparency, nor is every error discovered immediately or every question answered. As a result, the task involves dynamically and flexibly managing an increasing number of unexpected events... Essentially, it involves damage control.
